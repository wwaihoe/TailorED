### Generative AI Powered Personalized Learning for University Students

Traditional education systems often employ a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to address the diverse learning needs of individual students. Adopting personalized education methods is crucial for ensuring the effective learning of university students by catering to their individual learning needs and bridging gaps in understanding. To this end, I present an AI assistant application that leverages generative AI models to provide a more effective and accessible personalized education experience for university students. The AI assistant consists of a context-aware chatbot, multiple-choice question (MCQ) practice tool, short-answer question (SAQ) practice tool, summarizer, and study plan generator that are designed to allow students to engage in self-directed learning and revision of course content more effectively. The AI assistant was evaluated to assess its effectiveness in enhancing the learning experience for university students. The evaluation results showed that the AI assistant was able to generate responses for the different tools with high accuracy and relevance with respect to the course material for university level education. This shows great potential for the AI assistant to enhance the personalized education experience for university students by acting as a 24/7 supplementary tool that can perpetually provide students with personalized learning support and feedback.
